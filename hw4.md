# const X vs X const

I prefer  ```const X``` but both stand advantages.

1. ```const X``` is a more common style, since ```const``` is a keyword and ```X``` is the type. Putting it in front makes it very clear. For example, ```const int``` clearly states that it's an integer type that is constant.

2. ```X const``` is not very common for human reading hobbits, especially for rookie programmers like me. However, in certain complex type declarations (like pointers to constants, constant pointers, or combinations of both), this notation can sometimes offer more clarity.

All in all, I think ```const X``` is better for beginner learning, but ```X const``` offers more clarity in some circumstances.
